[Get started with Expense Tracker](https://redux-expense-tracker.netlify.app/)
## Objectives
- Data management in front-end components
- Handling lifecycle methods and reusable logic with React Hooks
- Using client-side routes with React Router
- Interacting with an API Backend
- Using a state management container in a React application
- Modern redux with Redux toolkit
- Managing async workflow with Redux Sagas
- Basic data visualisation
- Functional Programming
- Meeting model client requirements

## Features
A single page application that allows users to keep track of expenses. After `Sign up` or `Log in`, users are authenticated and able to access the app. The home page allows for creating and managing categories of expenses. Clicking on `Track expenses` in any category opens up a `Track.it` page with information about expenses in a given list. Expenses can be added, edited and deleted as desired. The `Reports` page shows the total outcome of a user's expenses, _by categories_, in a doughnut chart. Lastly, the `Edit Profile` page allows users to edit their profile. _Expense Tracker_ is deployed on Netlify.
