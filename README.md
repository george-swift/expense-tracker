## Features
A single page application that allows users to track expenses. It largely follows the design idea by [Gregoire Vella](https://www.behance.net/gallery/13271423/Bodytrackit-An-iOs-app-Branding-UX-and-UI) on Behance. _Expense Tracker_ is primarily designed for mobile devices but support is available for larger screen sizes. To get started, `Sign up` to access the application. Three **main pages** are available to signed in users. The `Lists` page allows for managing lists of expenses if any. Clicking on `Track expenses` opens up a `Track.it` page with information about expenses in a given list. Expenses can be added, edited and deleted as desired. The `Reports` page shows an overview of users' expenditure while the `More` page allows users to edit their profile. _Expense Tracker_ is deployed on Netlify.
